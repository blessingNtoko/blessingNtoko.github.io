Hi, I am Blessing Ntoko, It's nice to meet you.

I am a multifacted creator with 2 years of professional experience as a Web Developer and a vested interest in all things 3D.
I have studied and graduated in Management Services at the University of Johannesburg as well as obtained an 
Information Technology: Systems Development (SAQA ID 48872) certificate after a year long learnership at Umuzi Academy.

I am currently a Freelance Web Developer and 3D Generalist exploring my creativity through website creation and 3D projects.

I am always looking for new mediums of expression that I can grow into in order to see just how far I can develop myself mentally, spiritually and creatively.

These are my current tools of creation:

A shaman is a being that incorporates a lot of disciplines into themselves in order to better serve their communities through healing, communication with spirits and coordinating
religious and cultural ceremonies. Being a spiritual person, I have always been interested in this concept and have asked myself, what would that look like in todays world where technology serves all of our needs and is
in a constant state of change? What does that look like when we have begun and continue to create a digital landscape where we as individual conscious entities interact with each other on a daily basis?
I wish to explore this, and translate the role of a shaman into the digital world, hence the pseudonym Digital_Shaman.

My aim as a digital shaman is to expand my skillset in order to traverse the digital space we humans have created for ourselves freely, and provide my services to all who may need them.
Whether it is web development or 3D modelling and animation, I aim to be the being you look to.
